# rock-paper-scissors

Planning

1) Computer choice = a function that randomly returns "rock","paper" or "scissors"

    a) get a random number between 0 and 1
    b) if lower than 0.33 returns "rock", if higher than 0.66 = returns "paper", else returns "scissors"

2) Human Choice = a function that returns "rock", "paper" or "scissors" depending on player input

    a) Get player input from a prompt
    b) if player types one of the 3 valid options, returns said option. Else, ask for player input again.
